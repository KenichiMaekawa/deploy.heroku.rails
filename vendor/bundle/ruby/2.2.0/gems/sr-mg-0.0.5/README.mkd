Minimalist way to build [gems](http://rubygems.org) and publish
them to [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org) using
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org).

-----

In your Rakefile:

    require "mg"
    MG.new("foo.gemspec")

The following tasks are now available:

    rake install
      Build and install as local gem

    rake install:edge
      Build and install edge as a local gem with
      version suffixed by ".999"

    rake package
      Build gem and tarball into dist/

And if you've specified `rubyforge_project`:

    rake rubyforge
      Publish the current version on Rubyforge

    rake rubyforge:gem
      Publish gem and tarball on rubyforge

    rake rubyforge:git
      Push to gitosis@rubyforge.org:<project name>.git
